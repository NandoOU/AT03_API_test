Feature: Feeding a cow

  Scenario Outline: feeding a suckler cow      # test.feature:3
    Given the cow weighs <weight> kg           # test.feature:4
    When we calculate the feeding requirements # test.feature:5
    Then the energy should be <energy> MJ      # test.feature:6
    And the protein should be <protein> kg     # test.feature:7

    Examples:
      | weight | energy | protein |
      | 450    | 26500  | 215     |
      | 500    | 29500  | 245     |
      | 575    | 31500  | 255     |
      | 600    | 37000  | 305     |

4 scenarios (4 undefined)
16 steps (16 undefined)

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^the cow weighs (\d+) kg$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When(/^we calculate the feeding requirements$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then(/^the energy should be (\d+) MJ$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then(/^the protein should be (\d+) kg$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
